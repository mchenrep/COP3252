# Contents
This repository contains all of my projects/assignments done for COP3252 (Advanced Programming in Java) course.

# Requirements
- JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
- JDK (Java Development Kit)
- Java 1.5.0 or above

# How To Run
1. Make sure you have all the requirements installed on your device
2. For HW1 and HW5, there is no runnable JAR file, so just extract the JAR file with `jar xvf hwX.jar`, and run the .java file(s) independently: `java fileName`
3. For the other HWs, the JAR file should be runnable so the command `java -jar hwX` will allow it to run
